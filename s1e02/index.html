<h2>Episode Summary</h2>
<div class="summary">

<h2>Part 1: The Golf Game</h2>
<p>Bertie is staying at the Wickham family house in the countryside. He is looking after his Aunt Agatha's dog, McIntosh. Bertie tells Jeeves that he is in love with Bobbie Wickham, but Jeeves does not approve. He thinks Bobbie causes too much trouble.</p>
<p>Bertie plays golf against his friend Barmy. Barmy has a secret gadget that helps him play better. Also, McIntosh the dog keeps running onto the course and distracting Bertie. Bertie loses badly. Bobbie and everyone laugh at him.</p>

<h2>Part 2: The Water Bottle Trick</h2>
<p>Bobbie tells Bertie about a trick from her school days. You take a long stick with a needle, go to someone's room at night, and make a hole in their hot water bottle through the bed covers. Bertie thinks this is a brilliant idea to get revenge on Barmy.</p>
<p>But there is a problem. Jeeves knows that Barmy changed rooms with Professor Cluj and his wife. Jeeves does not tell Bertie. So Bertie goes to the wrong room in the dark. He makes a hole in the Professor's water bottle! The Professor and his wife wake up very angry.</p>
<p>It gets worse. Bobbie told the same trick to Barmy! So Barmy went and made a hole in Bertie's water bottle too. Lady Wickham is very angry and asks Barmy to leave the house.</p>
<p>Bertie finally understands that Bobbie played a joke on both of them. He is no longer in love with her.</p>

<h2>Part 3: The Missing Dog</h2>
<p>Back in London, Bobbie asks Bertie to host a lunch for Mr Blumenfield, an important American theatre producer, and his young son. Bobbie wants Blumenfield to buy her mother's play.</p>
<p>During lunch, the boy likes McIntosh the dog very much. Bobbie gives the dog to the boy as a present! This is a disaster because Aunt Agatha is coming back today and wants her dog.</p>
<p>Jeeves makes a clever plan. He puts aniseed on Bertie's trousers. Dogs love the smell of aniseed. Bertie goes to the hotel, sings a song that McIntosh loves, and the dog follows him home.</p>
<p>Then Blumenfield comes to Bertie's flat looking for the dog. Jeeves tells him that Bertie is a dangerous crazy person. Blumenfield runs away scared. Jeeves also buys another dog that looks the same to give to the boy. Aunt Agatha arrives and gets her dog back. Problem solved!</p>

<h2>Part 4: Tuppy and the Opera Singer</h2>
<p>Bertie's friend Tuppy Glossop has fallen in love with Cora Bellinger, an opera singer. He stopped seeing Angela, Aunt Dahlia's daughter. Aunt Dahlia is very unhappy about this.</p>
<p>Tuppy wants to impress Cora by singing a sad song called "Sonny Boy" at a charity show. He thinks this will show he has deep feelings.</p>
<p>Aunt Dahlia asks Bertie and Jeeves to break up Tuppy and Cora. Jeeves has a plan: Bertie will sing "Sonny Boy" first. When Tuppy sings the same song after, the audience will be tired of it and will not like his performance.</p>
<p>The plan works. Bertie sings first and the audience is not very kind. Then Tuppy sings the same song and everyone boos him. But Cora was not there to see it &mdash; her car broke down!</p>
<p>However, Jeeves planned ahead. When Cora finally arrives, Jeeves tells her that Tuppy wants her to sing "Sonny Boy". She does, and the audience boos her too! She is very angry and hits Tuppy in the eye. Their relationship is over, and Tuppy goes back to Angela.</p>

<h2>The Ending</h2>
<p>Everything is back to normal. Aunt Agatha has her dog. Tuppy is with Angela again. Bertie is no longer in love with Bobbie. And Bertie finally agrees to throw away his ugly golf trousers that Jeeves hated from the beginning.</p>
